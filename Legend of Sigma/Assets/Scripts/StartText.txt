YOU have been chosen...
to be an experiment for the new time travel machine!
The machine, created by the Sigma Corporation, is the first of its kind
and you were the only person brave enough to test it.
.....
.....
Well, good news!
It appears to have worked!
.....
However...
You jumped too far ahead into a post-apocalyptic era!
To escape, you must use the time machine to travel back.
But the machine is completely out of power.
You must collect batteries to restore the machine and get home safely.
Good luck!
